    title: "About this game",
    text: `This game "1 vs. 100" is based on the American television show "1 vs. 100", where one main player competes against 100 other contestants. Players respond to multiple-choice questions asked by the host. The main player is either randomly selected or predetermined before the game begins. Unlike ordinary players, the main player has no time restrictions on answers and has access to three unique hints.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How to play",
    text: `The gameplay proceeds in rounds. In each round, the host presents a question, and players are given 10 seconds to choose their answer. Regular players who provide incorrect answers are eliminated from the game and cannot participate further in answering questions. The main player has the option to use hints to determine the answer and is not limited by time for making their selection.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Use hints",
    text: `The main player is entitled to use three hints during the game, each one only once. The first hint allows skipping a question. The second hint reveals the answers from two randomly selected regular players, based on which the main player may decide their own answer. The third hint, "majority's opinion," automatically selects the answer most popular among the remaining players.`,
  },
  {
    title: "When the game ends",
    text: `The game ends in two scenarios. First: all remaining regular players give incorrect answers to a question or do not answer at all, resulting in the main player being declared the winner. Second: the main player gives an incorrect answer, but at least one of the regular players answers correctly. The number of points earned by the main player is determined by the number of correct answers and skipped questions, and these are displayed at the end of the game.`,
